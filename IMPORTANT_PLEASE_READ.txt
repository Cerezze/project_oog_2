HELLO viewer!

I intend to make this a full front and back end app project.
What you will see for now is a fully functional app with functions
for both content creators and users. However, there are many things 
that I will do that I havent gotten around to yet. Nevertheless,
I believe that this project is fully featured enough to show.

(PLEASE DO NOT USE YOUR REAL EMAIL ADDRESS OR PASSWORD THAT ALREADY 
EXISTS IN YOUR ACCOUNTS. THIS IS FOR TESTING ONLY. If you do use a 
real email address, I will inform you view the email you provided and I will delete it.)

** To run my project please see the README as it details how to get started with this
REACT.JS project.
