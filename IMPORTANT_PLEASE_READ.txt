HELLO viewer!

I intend to make this a full front and back end app project.
What you will see for now is a fully functional app with functions
for both content creators and users. However, there are many things 
that I will do that I havent gotten around to yet. Nevertheless,
I believe that this project is fully featured enough to show.

(PLEASE DO NOT USE YOUR REAL EMAIL ADDRESS OR PASSWORD THAT ALREADY 
EXISTS IN YOUR ACCOUNTS. THIS IS FOR TESTING ONLY. If you do use a 
real email address, I will inform you view the email you provided and I will delete it.)

Below I will list the things I intend to fix over time:

- for the best experience currently please view at BROWSER WIDTH: 1217px.
I am currently working on improving the look of this site on smaller screens.
This is my current priority going forward.

- The search box DOES NOT work with capital letters, nor does the black drop down
adjust to the number of items in the list. I intend to fix this, but I think 
what I have is currently useable so it is not a priority. (Again please use 
lowercase letters for the search box).

- If You are viewing the code, please note that I am aware that it is not optimized
nor is it clean, commented (and somethimes not modularized enough). This is just a 
front end portfolio piece for now so with it being functional, I will try my best to 
improve upon the code as much as possible going forward. If you have any questions about
the Code please do not hesitate to ask me via email: gm.c.burzo@gmail.com.

** To run my project please see the README as it details how to get started with this
REACT.JS project.
